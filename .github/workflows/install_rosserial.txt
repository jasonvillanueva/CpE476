Installing the ROS package that passes the serial messages on to ROS Master.

Simply run:

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial

2. Installing the ROSlib for the arduino:

For this, navigate in ‘Terminal’ to the libraries folder of the Arduino IDE, this is usually located at:

/home/Arduino/libraries 

and then run,

rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .

That dot at the end is important, it specifies the installation path. Which is the current path in the terminal.

A new folder will appear, ‘ros_lib’ which contains all that is needed for the Arduino part.

Test Run !
The steps arre:

    In the Arduino IDE go to: File/Examples/ros_lib/HelloWorld.
    upload this Sketch to the Arduino, if you get an avr_dude() error, use this link. :)
    In ‘Terminal’, launch ROS Master with,

roscore

4. in a new ‘Terminal’ window, run the ROS node that passes on the serial data, type and run

rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

you should change ‘/dev/ttyACM0’ to whatever port your Arduino is connected on.

5. listening in on the topics. We can list the topics in yet another ‘Terminal’ window using

rostopic list

You should see the ‘/chatter’ topic in the list. we can see the messages published on this topic using,

rostopic echo /chatter

Done!

You should see the message ‘hello world!’ being printed out again and again.
